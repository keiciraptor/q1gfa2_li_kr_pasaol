        <h1>My Dearest Floral Patch;</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I have loved you since the day I first laid my eyes on you, how you were able to bring and introduce yourself
            in a crowd that you're not familiar with. When we first talked with one another I was amazed and surprised how
            your voice can create such an impact towards me. I've always been misunderstood by those around me, yet you saw
            the best in me, especially in my darkest days. When everyone was accusing me for lying, you chose to hear and see
            the truth in me. I was once the archer who seeks for their prey, but I also have been the prey who ran from the archer,
            Who could ever leave me, darling? But who could stay? You... you stayed, you chose to stay, despite the attempts of mine 
            to push you away, despite me ghosting and leaving you out of the blue. You waited and reached for me, never giving up. You
            saw right through me, you saw through the person I keep on hiding, you read me like an open book. We started as friends, but 
            I'm not certain if we'll end up as lovers, I will only hope for that day to happen, but if it won't... then I'll be grateful for
            the memories, happiness, pain, and love that you gave me. I know that my love should be celebrated but you tolerate it. I'll wait for you even if it means waiting for nothing.
        </p>
